# Welcome, Everyone! ðŸ‘‹

## A little bit about me
My name is James. I'm a software engineer that likes to dabble in a whole mess of things. As such, the repositories found here can encompass a broad range of languages and technologies. I've worked in the software industry professionally since around 2008 and have worked in a variety of technologies/languages over the years:

- C/C++ and STL
- C#/.NET using Silverlight, WPF, XNA/MonoGame and WCF
- Java
- HTML/CSS/JS with React, Node/NPM, Express
- Python, PHP
- SQL/MySQL/PostgreSQL
- Kusto, PowerBI and Splunk
- Bash, Powershell
- Git, SourceDepot, SVN
- Visual Studio, VS Code, Eclipse and Source Insight
- Microsoft Office

I've recently updated my website from an old and outdated PHP-based site (that I originally wrote about ten years ago) to a simple, single-page web app using React. You can check it out here: [https://jeemusu.com/](https://jeemusu.com/)

I've also recently started up a new blog where I hope to chat about tech, programming and offer tutorials for learning Computer Science fundamentals and programming in different languages. You can find my blog here: [https://blog.jeemusu.com/](https://blog.jeemusu.com/)

## Let's play 20 questions!

#### What am I working on?
...a lot of study and interview prep. Refreshing my memory on fundamentals (algorithms and data structures) as well as Java and C#.

#### What am I learning?
My biggest investment in learning time has been Fullstack Development with [Zero-to-Mastery](https://zerotomastery.io/blog/). Previously I had only known the fundamentals of HTML/CSS and some Javascript. After taking the [The Complete Web Developer in 2020: Zero to Mastery](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery) course on Udemy I've learned so much about web development:

- A refined understanding of HTML/CSS/JS fundamentals with modern (as of 2020) standards of development
- Advanced JavaScript concepts like async programming, promises, ES6 modules, arrow functions, closures/IIFE, destructuring and more
- DOM manipulation, HTTP and Web APIs
- Frontend and backend development using React, Node/NPM, Express and interaction with relational databases using PostgreSQL
- Project organization and componentization of code into modules

I'm nearly finished with the course, and there is still ever more to learn!

#### Am I open for work?
Yes! I'm currently open to exploring new career opportunities.

#### What am I looking to collaborate on?
Projects that are interesting and serve communities or worthy causes. I'd love to contribute to open source in that realm.

#### How can you reach me?
Email works for starters: [jmethvin@jeemusu.com](mailto:jmethvin@jeemusu.com)

#### What pronouns do I prefer you use to address me?
He\Him

#### What's a fun fact about me?
I studied Japanese as my minor in college, I love the culture and the language (at least the parts of it I can remember...)
